<p><b>All of our advices are based on true experience and events to ensure accurate treatement given to our patients</p></b>
<p><h3>I have been dealing with prejudices for quite some time and I know how much it hurts getting a bad status for something you have not done.In fact my parents considered me a bad child.My mother and my sister thought I was a playboy and my dad thought I was a failure.This only grew worse when my sister's friends who were 18 years old associated me as a great pervert.The saddest thing here is that I was not what they thought I was,I always respected women and I have never played with someone's feelings,in fact it was a girl that broke my heart.Now I know that it hurts a lot and I even thought about commiting suicide.But I never killed myself,I continued helping people around me and I ignored my haters completely.I even decided to create this website to help people.The haters have no power,I continued living my life happily.If I had cared about what the haters said,I would not be here today.So my advice to you is that you should ignore those people and keep enjoying your life.YOU ARE NOT WHAT THEY TELL YOU.You are better than that.These people will only talk behind your back.They can't affect you in any way.Also remember that you are special and that you were brought down on this earth for a good purpose.So ignore these people and continue living because you are not what they call you,you are special.Just keep that in mind and continue living.Lift your right hand and place that on the left side of your chest,Do you hear that beating?It's your heart still beating till now.You were a given a reason to live this life and giving up so soon ain't of that reason I can ensure you that.Yes,I know it's hard for you to not care about their comments but whenever someone says something bad about you,think about something good about you.You were given this life to enjoy and to do stuff that you love.Ignore the haters and continue living</p></h3>

<p>I know what you are going through as I had passed throught this stage too.I will soon add a short story on this topic to show you what I went through but in the mean time,all you have to do is stop loving this girl.It will be hard to move on but you have to do it.It is the only way out of this madness.I'll give you something to do and repeat it everyday until all your feelings have gone for her.So listen to me;You don't need a girl to be able to live,you can do fine without her.So start forgeting about her.You are a man and you are strong.A girl cannot affect you!!Put what I told you in your head!A strong man does not need a girl.Put all of this in your head and repeat them in your head itself.Do it everyday.It will be hard but YOU ARE A MAN!!!A MAN IS STRONG AND IS NOT AFFECTED BY EMOTIONS AND YOU CAN DO IT.POU WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU IN YOUR HEAD!!YOU DON"T NEED A GIRL!KEP SAYING THOSE PHRASES OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!KEEP SAYING THEM!!YOU ARE A MAN AND YOU CAN DO IT!If you need any more advice,feel free to ask</p>
