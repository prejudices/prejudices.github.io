  <center><h2>DEALING WITH PREJUDICES PLACED ON YOU</h2></center>
<p><b>All of our advices are based on true experience and events to ensure accurate treatement given to our patients</p></b>
<p><h3>I have been dealing with prejudices for quite some time and I know how much it hurts getting a bad status for something you have not done.In fact my parents considered me a bad child.My mother and my sister thought I was a playboy and my dad thought I was a failure.This only grew worse when my sister's friends who were 18 years old associated me as a great pervert.The saddest thing here is that I was not what they thought I was,I always respected women and I have never played with someone's feelings,in fact it was a girl that broke my heart.Now I know that it hurts a lot and I even thought about commiting suicide.But I never killed myself,I continued helping people around me and I ignored my haters completely.I even decided to create this website to help people.The haters have no power,I continued living my life happily.If I had cared about what the haters said,I would not be here today.So my advice to you is that you should ignore those people and keep enjoying your life.YOU ARE NOT WHAT THEY TELL YOU.You are better than that.These people will only talk behind your back.They can't affect you in any way.Also remember that you are special and that you were brought down on this earth for a good purpose.So ignore these people and continue living because you are not what they call you,you are special.Just keep that in mind and continue living.Lift your right hand and place that on the left side of your chest,Do you hear that beating?It's your heart still beating till now.You were a given a reason to live this life and giving up so soon ain't of that reason I can ensure you that.Yes,I know it's hard for you to not care about their comments but whenever someone says something bad about you,think about something good about you.You were given this life to enjoy and to do stuff that you love.Ignore the haters and continue living</p></h3>

<p><i>My boyfriend and I don't share the same religion</i></p>
<p>You and your boyfriend are humans right?So why do you let this ideology known as religion seperate you?Don't worry about such things.If you love each other,then religion should not bother you.Don't worry about this and stay together.Religion must not affect your love towards each other.If people talk rubbish about you and your boyfriend because of religion,just ignore them.They have no power.The only thing that matters is that you need to stay together.So don't worry about religion and live happily together.I hope this did help you and I wish you a happy new year and loads of happiness in your life.</p>

<p><i>Heyy i am writing to you bcz i badly need your help guys. Infact i was crushing on a guy since a really really long time like nearly 7 months now but finally i am moving on now . But meanwhile there was a boy who wanted to date mee and me on the other hand was stuck with my crush i did chosse my crush over him who did not even care about my happiness but niw today i realised that i made a great mistake and now when i turned back i realised that the boiyy did move on and i really feel alone i dont fucking now what to do with my life i seriously want to commit suicide as i am fed up of every thing</p></i>
<p>Listen to me,you need to think positively.So let me tell you,first you crushed on a guy for seven months who did not even care about you and then there was someone who wanted to date you but you ignored him for a someone who does not care about you.I am going to agree that you commited a mistake but listen,you are still young.There is nothing wrong in making a mistake.The important thing is that you learn from it,and not suffer from it.So look at this scenario from another point of view,you made a mistake by loving the wrong person,now don't repeat it.That's all,you don't have to suffer because of that.You are still young and there is nothing wrong in comitting a mistake.Just learn from it and don't repeat it.Do not stress yourself or grieve about it.Just learn and be happy that you learnt something.Indeed mistakes make you a better person.Look at it in a positive manner where you improved yourself and would otherwise not have improved if there was not this mistake.You commited a mistake and you learnt from it.So don't suffer because of it.Now for the next thing,you are telling me you are feeling lonely and want to suicide?Well believe me,you are not lonely,you have lots of friends and a b=moodmaker who does a lot for you.Also why do you want to suicide?You must realise that you have lots of friends at school,a moodmaker and a cousin here for you.These boys are waste of time,ask yourself this question,where do these boys lead you?Do they buy your food?Do they give you a shelter?Well the answer is obviously no.You don't depend on them,they don't even stand by your side in tough times,only your special friends do that and your parents.So don't stress yourself about these useless things.Don't think about ending your life,because your parents and those who care about you will suffer.So don't stress yourself about such useless things.Think about the persons who care about you.Look at the good things in life and not the bad one.So what you need to do is:Don't suffer because of your mistakes,instead be grateful that they happened and made you a better person.Do not feel lonely as there are people who care about you.Lastly,look at the good things in life and think more positively.Also don't end up your life because of boys,they are useless and ending your life will result in the suffering of those who care about you.Also there are good things coming,so cheer up and live.</p>
<p><i>I love a guy but Im scared of being rejected or laugh at</p></i>
<p>My friend,never be scared of rejection.Go propose him,if he accepts,you will have a boyfriend and you will be happy.If he rejects you,well ignore him and don't be stressed about this,because a boy will not lead you far in life.So if he rejects you,well you just walk away that's all.Do not be afraid of rejection,it is just a plain word.Propose this boy,if he says yes,you shall be happy,if he says no,well you shall be happy again because rejection do not scare you and that boy is not important in your life</p>
<p><i>How can i ignore someone. The thing is that a boy keep coming in my mind even if he says bad words to me . I'll still say that he didn't mean it . And i wanna forget him . So my question is how do i forget him ?</i></p>
<p>Hey gurl, like I say, it’s all in your mind,he keeps being in your mind right? First step is to accept that you want to forget him, having the will to forget him, it’s only then, you will be able to, second, cut all contact from him! He will keep saying bad words to you🤷🏻‍♀️ You should stop interacting with such ppl, they aren’t worth you! You are worth more than this ok? The third, allow yourself to grieve! It will take time but times always heals and it’s true!Next is to keep you mind a bit off all thisDo stuff you love and be around people who love and respect you.So in short,cut all contact from him,block him,stop talking to him and then do things that you love,such as passing some good times with friends.You don't deserve a boy who says bad words to you.You are a great human being,so block him and spend time with people you love,some great friends or even your family.You can cry and grieve as much as you want,it will help you overcome the mentsl pains.In order to forget him,block him and stop interacting with him,then do things that you love,anything that you love,this will make you forget him after you have blocked him.Last part,allow yourself to grieve,it's not a shame to cry,so allow yourself to grieve.I hope this was helpful to you,if you need more advice,feel free to contact me on instagram @hisham_tarsoo or you can contact another admin who gives her advice @d.harshi.You can also ask on the website itself if you wish</p>
<p><i>I've had a crush on a guy for 3 years now. I like someone else tho. I don't understand if it is really a crush itself or not. I'm dating someone not to get rid of those thoughts but bcuz I actually like him. But my crush on the other boy isn't going. Idk what to do. In simple words I'm dating someone I like while I still have a crush on someone else for 3 yrs</i></p>
<p>Basically you are crushing on two guys at the same time right? You like that guy but at the same time you like the other one🤷🏻‍♀. Let me tell you that it’s normal to have two crushes since you are a teen, just don’t panic ok? But what you are doing is indeed wrong! I was going in the same situation as you but except I wasn’t going out with any of my two crushes, but because of the confusion of who to choose, I actually lost BOTH my best-friend and my close friend (my two crush). You have to be realistic ok? You can’t choose to go out with both of them. You will have to choose one of them. Either it’s guy Num 1 or guy Num 2. Plus the guy you are currently going out with, will be heart broken when he learns abt all this. Just take a break from the guy you are currently going out with and think abt all this. You have 2 options: Choose 1 of a these 2 or choose no one. But beware of the decision you make, and think properly. Take your time and think properly abt what you wanna do, if you need further advices just dm me on instagram @d.harshi</p>
<p><i>Thank you for the advice and one more thing. I have an older brother. He's older by four years . Every since I've been aware of existence and he have been in it , he curses me . Tells me that he wishes that i was dead , or i would have not been his sister and he even beats me sometimes. He even steals my things. As a boy and a brother i wanna ask you why does he do that . Every of my friends that have brothers , they tell me that their brothers love them . So why me. I didn't do anything to him . ... plz i need an advice or answer . .. plz Thnks for the previous advice . It really helped me.</i></p>
<p>I don’t have any brother so this is difficult for me to reply but I have friends who I consider as brothers. Being a boy, it’s difficult for him to express his feelings and emotions towards you since we live in a society where boys are said to ALWAYS be strong. However it can also be, he has a grudge against you. It does happens that before you were bon he was cared most in the family and now he is jealous you receive more attention. I recommend you to talk to him, try to figure things out, it is not right for him to treat you like that, you should stand up for yourself and ask him WHY? Why does he does that. Don’t just sit and assume things, go and talk to him! Or if yo can’t, talk to your parents. They are always there to help, Believe me.If he continues to beat you even after you talked with him,well you should tell the police about him because according to the law,he has no right to beat you.</p>
<p><i>I have a problem which no one can help me except God...well let's try... I am veryyyyy sick... Extremely sick.... Well physically I'm fit and fine..but spiritually.... I'm almost dead and that's maybe affecting me mentally.. I'm trying to hold onto myself.... I know you are not doctors but i would still like to share my problem and ask u to pray for me....</i></p>
<p>I may not be a psychologist or doctor of any sort but what I can tell you,it's that a healthy mind is always positive.The advice that I can give you is to be positive.Have faith in God,believe that you will be fine.Think positive.I have had a case before when someone who had cancer told me about her problem,well I told her to be positive,I told her to believe in herself,I told her to believe that she will be able to fight the disease and she did,she could fight it.So it has proven to be effictive.So what I can tell you is to be positive,instead of saying:"I will die because of the disease",say:"I will fight the disease and I will live"Think in this way and you shall be healthy soon.If you have further problems,you can ask and we'll be happy to help you.</p>
